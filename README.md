- Contents by now:
    - Predict Churn based on Artificial neural network (Classification problem)
    - Discriminate dog and cat based on Convolutional Neural Network (Classification problem)
    - Stock price prediction based on LSTM (RNN)(Regression problem) Note: the result is not good now, need further parameter tune
